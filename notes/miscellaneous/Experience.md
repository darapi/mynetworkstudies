# Phone firmware issue

Users at location A were having issues calling users at location B
Users at location A would say the calls were dropping
Users at location B would say that they could nto hear anything

The issue was that calls were only one-way
Users at location B could not hear anyone at location A
Then users at location B would hang up
Users at location A thought the call "dropped" when location A would hang up

The problem turned out to be a firmware issue with the phone

Lessons learned:
It's not always a network issue
Users will give you slightly different explanations about the same problem, from their perspective
