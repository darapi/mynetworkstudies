# Network Architecture
- Three-Tier Hiearchy
- Two-Tier Hiearchy
- Spine-Leaf
- SOHO
- On-Premise vs Cloud


Three-Tier Hierarchy
- Core Layer (does routing)
- Distribution Layer (SVI / default gateway / routing between VLANs)
- Access Layer (switching only)

Two-Tier Hierarchy (Collapsed Core)
- Cheaper
- Combines Core Layer and Distribution Layer
- North-South traffic

Spine-Leaf Design (Data centers)
- Used in 
- East-West traffic
- Fabric - all the switches in the spine leaf topology


WAN Architecture
- Point-to-Point
	- Site A is directly connected to Site B
- Broadcast
	- Uses a fiber ring
	- All switches owned by ISP
- Non Broadcast Multi Access LAN


SOHO (Small Office Home Office)


On Premise/Cloud
