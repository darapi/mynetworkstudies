# What is a Network

- Two or more devices with the ability to communicate with each-other
- Can be wired or wirelesss
- Consists of **end devices**, **network devices** and **servers**


**End Devices**
- Devices that "use" the network
- Devices utilized by end users
- e.g. laptops, PC, smart phones, IP phones, printers, fax machines, tablets, cameras

**Network Devices**
- Devices that "create" the network infrastructure
- e.g. switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, access points
- These devices forward traffic from point A to point B
- Designed, configured, maintained by network engineers

**Servers**
- Provide some type of "service"
- e.g. Email server, File server, Time server, DHCP server, Domain server
- Email server - where all email is stored
- Time server - all devices on the network sync their time with this server
- DHCP server - gives out IP addresses to end devices
- DNS server - translates domain names to IP addresses
- File server - SToring and transfering files

**Private vs Public network**
- Private owned and manged by the company (secure)
- Public is accessible to the world (unsecure)

#### Remember:
- Network Device - Create the network. managed by engineers.
- End Device - Belongs to users. Computers and laptops.
- Server - Managed by server admins or network admins. Provide a service.


**What is "network engineering"?**
- The study of how devices communicate
- How does data get from point A to point B
- Building the infrastructure to make communication possible
- Designing and optimizing the network to fit business needs
- Troubleshooting issues that occur in the network
